# 🛍️ Project for “Wikishop”
Congratulations! You’ve completed the simulator course. Now it’s time to apply your knowledge to a new machine learning task — independently.
Once you finish, submit your work for review. You’ll receive feedback within 24 hours. You’ll then need to revise and resubmit your project. You may go through several rounds of revisions — that’s perfectly normal. The project is complete once the reviewer approves all revisions.

## 📘 Project Description
The online store “Wikishop” is launching a new feature: users can now edit and expand product descriptions, similar to wiki communities. Customers can suggest edits and comment on changes made by others.
The store needs a tool that can detect toxic comments and send them for moderation.
Your task is to train a model to classify comments as positive or negative. You’re provided with a labeled dataset indicating whether a comment is toxic.
Your model must achieve an F1 score of at least 0.75.

## 🛠️ Project Instructions
You can solve this task with or without BERT.
### If you want to use BERT:
- Run the project locally.
- The Jupyter Notebook in the simulator is limited to 4 GB of RAM, which may not be enough for BERT.
- Mention BERT in the project title in the first notebook cell.

### If you don’t use BERT:
- You can run the project locally or in the simulator.

### General Workflow:
1. Load and prepare the data.
2. Train different models.
3. Draw conclusions.

## 📂 Data Description
The dataset is located at /datasets/toxic_comments.csv.
- text — the comment text
- toxic — the target label (1 = toxic, 0 = non-toxic)

## ✅ Project Evaluation Criteria
Reviewers will assess:

- Whether all steps in the instructions are completed
- How you prepare the data
- Which models and hyperparameters you explore
- Whether you avoid code duplication
- The quality of your conclusions
- Project structure and code cleanliness
- Everything you need is covered in the cheat sheets and course notes.

Good luck! 🚀
